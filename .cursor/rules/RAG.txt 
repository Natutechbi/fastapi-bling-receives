Structure
1- This project is a Python application that uses the Bling API to retrieve data and save data to MongoDB;
2- This project uses MongoDB to store data;
3- This project  is deployed on VPS server Ubuntu 22.04 with Docker to containerize the application;
4- The VPS Server uses web server setup: Apache2 runs directly on the VPS, while Nginx is containerized. Only configure these when needed; otherwise, keep the project as is;
5- This project uses FastAPI Framework;
6- Uses modular python structure accross def functions and classes to organize code structure for writing maintainable code.

Instructions
1-Ensure that was added logging for successes and errors in all API calls, database connections, and data structures.
2-Ensure that all API calls on the project included a delay of 4 seconds, 3 times as rate limit. When not, implemented delay to prevent overwhelming the API with requests and avoid rate limiting.
3-Ensure loading environment variables from a .env file. keep sensitive information (like API keys) separate from the code on the project;
4-Ensures the project uses the America/Sao_Paulo timezone and verifies the current time is in UTC, consistently across the Dockerfile, Docker Compose file, and the project's code
5-Ensures that the Docker container, defined in the docker-compose.yml file, restarts automatically if it stops or crashes
6-Ensures that the requirements.txt file is updated to include all the necessary packages for the project, including those used in the Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, and the project's Python code

Functions

bling_sources.py functions: 
1- `get_bling_modules`: Retrieves modules from Bling API. Includes logging for success/failure, a 4-second delay, and uses environment variables for configuration.
2- `get_bling_vendors`: Its retrieves vendors from Bling API connect to MongoDB, delete existing data in a collection, and then insert new data.
3- `save_to_mongodb`: Saves data to MongoDB. Includes logging for success/failure, and uses environment variables for configuration.
4- `save_vendors_to_mongodb`: Saves vendor data to MongoDB. Includes logging for success/failure, and uses environment variables for configuration. This function connects to a MongoDB database, deletes any existing data in the specified collection, and then inserts the new vendor data.
5- `get_bling_sellers_data`: Retrieves seller data from the Bling API. It constructs a request to the API endpoint for sellers, including necessary headers for authentication. Upon successfully fetching the data, it transforms the JSON response into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation, performs data normalization and type conversions, and returns the data as a list of dictionaries. Error logging is included to capture any failures during the API request.
6- `get_bling_modulos_data`: Retrieves and processes data about modules and their statuses from the Bling API, merging the two datasets into a single structure, and also retrieves payment method data from the Bling API.
7- `get_bling_payment_methods_data`: Retrieve payment methods data from the Bling API. It makes a GET request to the appropriate API endpoint, including necessary authentication headers. After a successful API call, it processes the JSON response and transforms it into a Pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is then converted into a list of dictionaries, which is returned by the function. Logging is used to track the success or failure of the API request and data retrieval process.
8- `get_bling_receivable_data`: Retrieves receivable data from the Bling API for the last 30 days. It calculates the today and _30_day_ago dates to use as a date range for filtering the receivable data.
9- 'fetch_receivable_detail': Retrieves and processes receivable data from the Bling API, merging summary and detailed information, renaming columns, and formatting data types before returning a list of dictionaries.

accounts_receivable.py fuctions:
1- get_recent_receivables():
    - Connects to MongoDB using the environment variables
    - Calculates the date 5 days ago from the current date
    - Creates a query to find documents where dataEmissao_x is greater than or equal to 5 days ago
    - Executes the query and returns the results as a list
    - Also splits numeroDocumento into CR.PedidoNÂº and CR.PedOrd fields.
